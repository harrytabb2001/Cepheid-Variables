Fifth lab experiment from my second year undergraduate in Physics at The University of Manchester.

* Cepheid main.py contains all of the data anaylsis code used in the experiment. It is worth noting that I went significantly beyond what was required. The lab script recommended
using ds9 software; however, as a challenge I wrote my own python script to carry out the experiment and perform all data analysis. This was a valuable learning experience.
* Cepheid Variables Lab Script.pdf contains a breif outline of the experiment given to me before I started.
* Cepheid Lab Notebook.pdf contains my handwritten notes from during the experiment including a schematic diagram, key figures, snippets of the recorded data, calculations, data analysis and conclusions.
* Cepheid Variables Lab Report.pdf contains my written up lab report from after the experiment.
